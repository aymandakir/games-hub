# AETHERIS: ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS ADVENTURE
## Complete Design Document & Story Bible

---

## 1. CORE CONCEPT

**Game Title:** Aetheris: The Symbol War

**Genre:** Narrative-driven RPG with Rock-Paper-Scissors combat system

**Platform:** Browser-based web game

**Target Audience:** Teens and young adults (13-25) who enjoy light RPGs with simple mechanics and strong storytelling

**Core Hook:** An epic fantasy adventure where the ancient forces of Rock, Paper, and Scissors define everything—from magic and culture to personal identity. Players choose between a male or female protagonist and explore a world on the brink of collapse, where every battle is a strategic RPS duel with RPG depth.

## 2. PLAYER CHARACTERS

### MALE PROTAGONIST

**Canonical Name:** Kael (alternatives: Riven, Torin)

**Age:** 20

**Background:** Grew up in the border village of Crosspoint, where all three factions meet. His parents ran a trading post that served travelers from Rock, Paper, and Scissor dominions. Kael learned to read people from all three cultures, but never felt fully accepted by any single faction.

**Personality:**
- Curious and persistent—won't let a mystery go unsolved
- Slightly sarcastic but fundamentally kind
- Quick-witted, uses humor to deflect emotional situations
- Has a chip on his shoulder about not belonging anywhere

**Motivation:** Discovers his family's trading post was destroyed during "The Tearing" when he was a child, and his parents' deaths weren't accidental. He wants to uncover the truth about what really happened and restore balance so no other families suffer the same fate.

**Main Strengths:**
- Adaptable: Can blend into any faction's culture
- Observant: Notices details others miss
- Resilient: Bounces back from setbacks quickly

**Main Flaws:**
- Trust issues: Has trouble fully trusting anyone
- Impulsive: Sometimes acts before thinking through consequences
- Self-doubt: Questions if he's truly capable of saving the world

**Signature Combat Style:** **Paper-Aligned** (60% Paper affinity, 25% Rock, 15% Scissors)
- Prefers strategic, defensive play
- Uses Paper moves to read opponents and counter their patterns
- His Symbol Break is called "Ink Storm" — a flurry of paper attacks that confuse and overwhelm

**Visual Design:**
- Medium brown hair, messy and unkempt
- Wears a patchwork cloak combining elements from all three factions
- Amber eyes that seem to see through people
- Lean build, quick movements
- Carries a journal (Paper-aligned artifact) from his parents

---

### FEMALE PROTAGONIST

**Canonical Name:** Lyra (alternatives: Sera, Zara)

**Age:** 19

**Background:** Also from Crosspoint village, but her family was different—they were scholars who documented the history of all three factions. When she was 12, her older brother vanished during a research expedition into the Scissor Dominion. The only clue: a strange triangular mark appeared on her left hand the day he disappeared.

**Personality:**
- Clever and strategic—thinks three steps ahead
- Empathetic but with a sharp tongue when provoked
- Methodical and detail-oriented
- More serious than Kael, but has a dry wit

**Motivation:** The same global goal (restore balance), but her personal drive is finding her missing brother and understanding the mysterious mark on her hand. She suspects the mark is connected to the fourth hidden symbol mentioned in ancient texts.

**Main Strengths:**
- Analytical: Excellent at pattern recognition and strategy
- Determined: Won't give up on finding her brother
- Diplomatic: Can navigate complex social situations

**Main Flaws:**
- Overthinking: Sometimes paralyzed by too many options
- Stubborn: Once she forms a theory, hard to change her mind
- Emotionally guarded: Hides vulnerability behind intellect

**Signature Combat Style:** **Scissors-Aligned** (60% Scissors affinity, 25% Paper, 15% Rock)
- Prefers precision and speed
- Uses Scissors moves to cut through defenses and strike quickly
- Her Symbol Break is called "Blade Cascade" — a series of rapid, precise strikes that break through any defense

**Visual Design:**
- Dark hair in a practical braid
- Wears practical scholar's robes with hidden blade compartments
- Sharp green eyes, always calculating
- Athletic build, graceful but ready to strike
- The triangular mark on her left hand glows faintly during combat
- Carries her brother's research notes

## 3. WORLD BUILDING: AETHERIS

### GEOGRAPHY

Aetheris is a continent divided into three distinct regions, each shaped by its dominant force. The land itself responds to the balance—or imbalance—of these powers.

#### **Rock Dominion**
- **Terrain:** Mountainous, with deep mines and stone fortresses carved into cliffs
- **Major Cities:** 
  - **Granitehold:** Capital city, built into a massive mountain. Entire districts are underground.
  - **Ironforge:** Mining town where the best weapons are crafted
- **Architecture:** Heavy stone structures, rounded edges, built to last millennia
- **Climate:** Cool, dry, with frequent earthquakes (especially when balance is off)
- **Resources:** Precious metals, gems, stone for construction

#### **Paper Dominion**
- **Terrain:** Wind-swept plains, floating scroll cities held aloft by Paper magic
- **Major Cities:**
  - **Scriptoria:** The great library city, where knowledge is currency
  - **Aeropolis:** Floating city that drifts with the winds
- **Architecture:** Light, airy structures that seem to flow. Buildings made of enchanted paper that's stronger than steel
- **Climate:** Constant gentle winds, occasional storms that carry messages
- **Resources:** Rare inks, enchanted scrolls, wind-crystals

#### **Scissor Dominion**
- **Terrain:** Blade forests (trees with metallic leaves), sharp cliffs, metal markets
- **Major Cities:**
  - **Edgehaven:** Port city where all trade routes converge
  - **Razor's Rest:** Training grounds for elite warriors
- **Architecture:** Angular, sharp lines, everything designed for precision and efficiency
- **Climate:** Variable, but always crisp and clear
- **Resources:** Refined metals, precision tools, cutting-edge technology

#### **Neutral Hub: Crosspoint**
- **History:** Founded 200 years ago as a trading post where all three factions could meet safely. It's the only place where all three forces are in perfect balance, making it a neutral ground.
- **Visual Signature:** The city is built in three concentric rings—outer ring (Rock-style), middle ring (Paper-style), inner ring (Scissors-style). At the center is the Grand Plaza, where a massive three-sided monument represents the balance.
- **Unique Feature:** The balance is so perfect here that RPS battles are always fair—no faction has an advantage. This makes it the ideal place for diplomacy and trade.

---

### MAGIC/POWER SYSTEM

The three forces aren't just combat techniques—they're fundamental aspects of reality in Aetheris.

#### **Rock = Defense, Strength, Earth**
- **Daily Life Uses:**
  - Construction: Rock-aligned builders can shape stone with their hands
  - Mining: Can sense precious metals underground
  - Defense: Natural ability to create barriers and shields
  - Agriculture: Strengthen soil, grow hardy crops
- **Combat:** High HP, defensive abilities, can absorb damage
- **Philosophy:** "Stand firm, endure, protect"

#### **Paper = Strategy, Manipulation, Wind**
- **Daily Life Uses:**
  - Communication: Paper-aligned can send messages on the wind
  - Knowledge: Enhanced memory, can "read" situations
  - Diplomacy: Natural ability to understand and influence others
  - Weather: Can call gentle winds, predict storms
- **Combat:** Medium HP, can predict enemy moves, debuff opponents
- **Philosophy:** "Adapt, understand, outthink"

#### **Scissors = Speed, Precision, Metal**
- **Daily Life Uses:**
  - Crafting: Can work metal with incredible precision
  - Travel: Enhanced speed and agility
  - Medicine: Surgical precision, can make precise cuts
  - Technology: Invent and improve mechanical devices
- **Combat:** Lower HP but high speed, critical hits, can bypass defenses
- **Philosophy:** "Strike fast, cut true, move forward"

**Affinity System:**
- Every person has a natural alignment (usually 60-70% one force, 20-30% another, 10% the third)
- Affinity affects:
  - Combat effectiveness with that move type
  - Passive bonuses (Rock = +HP, Paper = +Resolve gain, Scissors = +Speed)
  - How NPCs react to you
  - Which areas feel more "home-like"

---

### LORE

#### **The Tearing**
Fifty years ago, a cataclysmic event shattered the balance between the three forces. The exact cause is unknown, but the effects were devastating:
- Massive earthquakes in Rock Dominion
- Paper cities lost their ability to float, crashing to the ground
- Scissor blades became unstable, shattering randomly
- The three factions blamed each other, leading to a cold war

**Theories:**
- Some say a fourth force tried to emerge
- Others believe someone deliberately disrupted the balance
- A few whisper about a "Hidden Symbol" that was discovered and then hidden again

#### **The Hidden Symbol**
Legends speak of a fourth symbol that existed before the three forces split. It's said to be:
- A triangle (combining all three forces)
- The source of true balance
- Lost or hidden after The Tearing
- Only appears to those who can unite all three forces

Each faction interprets it differently:
- **Rock:** Believes it's a foundation stone that must be restored
- **Paper:** Thinks it's a lost text that holds the secret
- **Scissors:** Claims it's a master blade that can cut through anything

#### **Cultural Interpretations**

**Rock Order:**
- Values: Strength, endurance, tradition
- Clothing: Heavy fabrics, earth tones, practical
- Architecture: Built to last, rounded and solid
- Traditions: Stone-carving ceremonies, endurance trials

**Paper Scholars:**
- Values: Knowledge, adaptation, understanding
- Clothing: Flowing robes, light fabrics, often with scroll patterns
- Architecture: Elegant curves, open spaces, libraries everywhere
- Traditions: Storytelling circles, knowledge-sharing festivals

**Scissor Blades:**
- Values: Precision, progress, efficiency
- Clothing: Sharp lines, metallic accents, functional design
- Architecture: Angular, precise, always improving
- Traditions: Precision contests, innovation showcases

#### **Final Boss: The Shattered Leader**

**Phase 1:** Uses distorted RPS (as described in combat system)
**Phase 2:** Becomes a fusion of all three forces (can use all three simultaneously)

## 10. EXAMPLE DIALOGUES

### DIALOGUE 1: MEETING MASTER THORNE (ACT I)

**Scene:** Crosspoint Village, after the initial incident. Player approaches Master Thorne's workshop.

**Thorne:** (Looks up from his workbench, missing arm clearly visible) "Ah. So you felt it too, did you?"

**Player Choice:**
- **Rock:** "What was that? I need answers." (Direct)
- **Paper:** "I'm trying to understand what happened." (Diplomatic)
- **Scissors:** "You know something. Tell me." (Sharp)

**Thorne (responding to Rock choice):**
"Straight to the point. I like that. What you saw—that symbol in the sky—it's been fifty years since anyone's seen it. Not since The Tearing."

**Thorne (responding to Paper choice):**
"Curious mind. Good. What you're asking about... it's connected to something bigger. Something your family was involved in."

**Thorne (responding to Scissors choice):**
"Sharp. You cut right to it. Fine. That symbol? It's why your parents are dead. And if we don't figure this out, a lot more people will join them."

**Thorne (continues, regardless of choice):**
"I can't tell you everything here. Too many ears. But if you're serious about this—really serious—meet me at the Grand Plaza tonight. Come alone."

---

### DIALOGUE 2: FIRST MEETING WITH BLADE CAPTAIN ZARA (ACT II)

**Scene:** Scissor Dominion, training grounds. Zara is practicing when player arrives.

**Zara:** (Doesn't look up, continues training) "You're the one everyone's talking about. The 'balance restorer.'" (Slight sarcasm)

**Player Choice:**
- **Rock:** "I don't care about talk. I care about results." (Direct challenge)
- **Paper:** "I'm just trying to help. Maybe we can work together?" (Diplomatic)
- **Scissors:** "And you're the 'Blade Captain.' Impressive title. Can you back it up?" (Sharp, competitive)

**Zara (responding to Rock choice):**
(Smiles, finally looks at you) "Confident. I like that. Prove it. Best me in a duel, and I'll listen to whatever you have to say."

**Zara (responding to Paper choice):**
(Stops training, studies you) "Diplomatic. Smart. But words won't cut it here. Show me you can fight, and maybe we'll talk."

**Zara (responding to Scissors choice):**
(Eyes light up with competitive fire) "Oh, I like you. Challenge accepted. Let's see if you can keep up."

**Zara (continues):**
"Three rounds. Rock, Paper, Scissors. Standard rules. If you win, I'll help you with whatever you need. If I win... well, let's just say you'll have a new respect for Scissor techniques."

### DIALOGUE 3: CONFRONTING THE SHATTERED LEADER (ACT III)

**Scene:** Final dungeon, the Convergence Point. Player faces the leader of The Shattered.

**Shattered Leader:** (Hooded figure, voice distorted) "You've come far. Further than I expected. But you still don't understand."

**Player Choice:**
- **Rock:** "I understand enough. You're destroying the balance. That ends now." (Direct confrontation)
- **Paper:** "Help me understand. Why do you think destroying everything is the answer?" (Diplomatic, seeking truth)
- **Scissors:** "Your methods are flawed. The three forces aren't the problem—people like you are." (Sharp critique)

**Shattered Leader (responding to Rock choice):**
"Destroying? No. I'm *fixing*. The three-force system is broken. It caused The Tearing. It will cause another. The only solution is to start over—or restore what came before."

**Shattered Leader (responding to Paper choice):**
"Finally, someone who asks instead of attacks. The three forces... they're incomplete. There was a fourth. A balance. But it was hidden, locked away. I'm trying to free it."

**Shattered Leader (responding to Scissors choice):**
"Flawed? Perhaps. But necessary. Your parents—" (pauses, revealing knowledge) "—they tried the peaceful way. Look where that got them."

**Shattered Leader (reveals face—different for Kael vs Lyra):**
- **For Kael:** "I knew your parents. They were good people. But they were wrong. The only way to prevent another Tearing is to destroy the three-force system entirely."
- **For Lyra:** "Your brother... he found the truth. The Hidden Symbol isn't a fourth force—it's the *combination* of all three. But accessing it requires sacrifice. He made that choice."

**Shattered Leader (final words before battle):**
"The choice is yours. Join me, and we'll rebuild everything properly. Or fight me, and watch the world tear itself apart again. But know this—I'm not the villain here. I'm trying to save everyone."

## CONCLUSION

This design document provides a complete foundation for "Aetheris: The Symbol War." Every element is designed to work together cohesively, from the worldbuilding to the combat system to the character arcs. The RPS mechanic is simple enough to be accessible but deep enough to support an engaging RPG experience.

The story balances personal stakes (family, missing sibling) with epic stakes (saving the world), and the gender choice creates meaningful differences in both narrative and gameplay.

**Next Steps for Development:**
1. Create art assets (character portraits, UI elements, backgrounds)
2. Implement combat system
3. Build dialogue system
4. Create node-based overworld
5. Write full script for all story beats
6. Implement save/load system
7. Add sound effects and music
8. Playtest and balance difficulty

This document is ready to be converted into a playable game.
