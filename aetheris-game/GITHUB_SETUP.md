# How to Add Website Link to GitHub Repository

## Quick Steps

1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/aymandakir/games-hub
2. Click the **⚙️ Settings** icon (gear icon) next to "About" section (on the right sidebar)
3. In the "Website" field, enter: `https://games-hub-kappa.vercel.app`
4. Click **Save changes**

Alternatively:

1. Go to your repository homepage
2. Look for the **"About"** section on the right sidebar
3. Click the **pencil icon** (✏️) next to "Website"
4. Enter: `https://games-hub-kappa.vercel.app`
5. Click **Save changes**

## What This Does

- Adds a clickable link in the repository's "About" section
- Makes it easy for visitors to access the live site
- The link appears prominently on your repository homepage

## Current Live URLs

- **Main Hub**: https://games-hub-kappa.vercel.app
- **Hippo Game**: https://games-hub-kappa.vercel.app/hippo-game.html
- **Aetheris Game**: https://games-hub-kappa.vercel.app/aetheris-game (when deployed)

## Note

The Aetheris game is a Next.js app, so you may need to:
1. Deploy it separately on Vercel, OR
2. Configure Vercel to serve it from the `/aetheris-game` path

For now, the main hub link works and is ready to add to GitHub!
